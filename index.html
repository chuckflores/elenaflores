      <p>
        Originally from Stafford, VA, soprano Elena Flores is currently in her second year at UNC Greensboro (UNCG) pursuing her Master’s in Vocal Performance. There she studies with Clara O’Brien. Last year at UNCG she performed Laetitia in Menotti’s The Old Maid and the Thief, Sister Constance in Poulenc’s The Dialogues of the Carmelites, and was named the Grand Prize winner of UNCG’s 2016 Student Artist Competition. Flores earned her B.M. from Shenandoah University, where some of her roles included Adele in Strauss’s Die Fledermaus, Cendrillon in Massenet's Cendrillon, and Judy in Lee Hoiby’s This is the Rill Speaking. She strives for vocal versatility and honest performance as she seeks to touch the hearts of others through music.
